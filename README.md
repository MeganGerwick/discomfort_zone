## General info

If you’re tired of the same old menu, and of places where “everybody knows your name”, Discomfort Zone is here to help you get out of the monotony of comfort.
Using your location and how long you’re willing to travel (get discomfortable!) our web app finds new restaurants on the edge outside of your comfort zone.

Discomfort Zone uses a default location starting in KC or confirms default location based on user’s browser.
The user will enter a street address and how far they are willing to travel. Discomfort Zone will then list the several restaurants on the edge of the area that the user is willing to travel to.

This project was created as the first project for the part-time coding bootcamp at the University of Kansas by Megan Gerwick, Biaka Zaidarhzauva, and Greg Stead
